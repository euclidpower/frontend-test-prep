# frontend-test
The app is currently written in `React 18` with `TypeScript`. We rely on MUI as our design system.

Since the backend is not ready yet, we are using `msw` acting as a server during development and testing.

The tests are written with `vitest` (which has a `jest` compatible API) and `testing-library`.

## Quick start
- Clone this repo
- Install `node` 20
- Install the dependencies,`npm i`

You can run the dev server with `npm start`, run the tests once with `npm test`, and keep them running with `npm run tdd`.
